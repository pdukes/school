		<p>I am interested heavily in Information Technology and have a passion for apps, software and games. I enjoy a good laugh or two and I appreciate several sports such as Soccer, Rugby League and Hockey. I'm also interested in history and the involvement of militaries in the past, present and potential future.</p>
